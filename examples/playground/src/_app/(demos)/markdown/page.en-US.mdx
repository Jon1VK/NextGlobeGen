# Markdown Pages

NextGlobeGen has a support for MDX pages by using a locale specific file convention.

Create a `page.<locale>.mdx` file for each configured locale in the route segment directory from where the markdown page should be served. NextGlobeGen will use the correct markdown page for each locale based on the `<locale>` part of the filename.
