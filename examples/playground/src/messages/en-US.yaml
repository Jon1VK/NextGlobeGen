      <p>The pathnames in the url often need to be translated to improve SEO. In
      NextGlobeGen this is done for each route segment (directory) separately
      with special i18n.ts files. With this approach the route segment and
      it's localizations can be colocated.</p>
      <p>Try changing between languages and check the address bar.</p>
