# Routing

With NextGlobeGen, the application routes are created to a special `src/_app` directory. In this directory all Next.js file-system based routing rules apply and all Next.js specific routing files work exactly the same as in `src/app` directory. Localized routes are generated to `src/app/(i18n)` directory based on the contents in the `src/_app` origin directory.

The localized route directory `src/app/(i18n)` should not be modified. Other non-localized routes and files, such as `api` routes and `favicon.ico` file, can still be added to the root of the `src/app` directory.

In addition to Next.js specific routing files, NextGlobeGen adds a few routing file conventions of its own. NextGlobeGen also passes the current locale to all functions that cannot infer it from the rendering context.

:::info Configuring directory locations

Default directory locations can be altered through [configuration](./api-reference/configuration.mdx#routes).

:::

## Localized pathnames

The pathnames in the url often need to be translated to improve SEO. In NextGlobeGen this is done for each route segment (directory) separately with special `i18n.ts` files. With this approach the route segment and it's localizations can be colocated.

:::info Translating dynamic params

The `i18n.ts` file is only used for translating static route segments. Dynamic params are translated by manually providing translated params to the [`Link`](./api-reference/components.mdx#link) component. Check the [example](<https://github.com/Jon1VK/NextGlobeGen/tree/main/examples/playground/src/_app/(demos)/dynamic>).

:::

### Static translations

The simplest way to translate a route segment is to export as a default export an object which includes localized versions of the route segment for each locale.

```ts title="src/_app/dashboard/i18n.ts"
const segmentTranslations = {
  en: "dashboard", // If omitted, the directory name is used
  fi: "hallintapaneeli",
};

export default segmentTranslations;
```

### With an async function

Another way to translate a route segment is to export as a default export an async function that returns the route segment localizations as an object.

```ts title="src/_app/dashboard/i18n.ts"
export default async function generateSegmentTranslations() {
  /* Fetch translations for example from an external source  */
  return {
    en: "dashboard", // If omitted, the directory name is used
    fi: "hallintapaneeli",
  };
}
```

:::info

- Each [parallel route](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes) segment needs to be localized separately.
- [Intercepted route](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes) segments have to include the segment matcher in the translations. For example a Finnish translation of `(..)photo` would be `(..)kuva`.

## Markdown pages

NextGlobeGen has a support for MDX pages by using a locale specific file convention. To use markdown pages, first follow [Next.js MDX docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/mdx) on how to configure Next.js so it can process MDX.

Then create a `page.<locale>.mdx` file for each configured locale in the route segment directory from where the markdown page should be served. NextGlobeGen will use the correct markdown page for each locale based on the `<locale>` part of the filename.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="English MDX Page" >

```mdx title="./src/_app/markdown/page.en.mdx"
export const metadata = { title: "Markdown page" };

# Markdown page

This content is shown on `/en/markdown` path.
```

</TabItem >
<TabItem value="Finnish MDX Page">

```mdx title="./src/_app/markdown/page.fi.mdx"
export const metadata = { title: "Markdown sivu" };

# Markdown sivu

Tämä sisältö näytetään `/fi/markdown` polussa.
```

</TabItem >
</Tabs>

## Localized 404 page

To catch unmatched `/<locale>/**/*` URLs, two files are required:

1. `src/_app/[...catchAll]/page.tsx`
2. `src/_app/not-found.tsx`

The `[...catchAll]/page.tsx` is rendered for all unmatched URLs and `not-found.tsx` catches all `notFound()` calls.

Now by calling `notFound()` in `[...catchAll]/page.tsx` the UI defined in the `not-found.tsx` file will be rendered.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Catch-all page" >

```tsx title="./src/_app/[...catchAll]/page.tsx"
import { notFound } from "next/navigation";

export default function CatchAllPage() {
  notFound();
}
```

</TabItem >
<TabItem value="Localized 404 page">

```tsx title="./src/_app/not-found.tsx"
export default function NotFound() {
  /* Return localized UI using next-globe-gen APIs */
}
```

</TabItem >
</Tabs>

## Language alternates

NextGlobeGen package injects [language alternates](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata#alternates) to the metadata objects for all page routing files. Alternate language links are required to be defined as absolute URLs. As so the [`metadataBase`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata#metadatabase) property needs to be set in the `src/_app/layout.tsx` file.

```tsx title="src/_app/layout.tsx"
import type { Metadata } from "next";

export function generateMetadata(): Metadata {
  return {
    metadataBase: new URL("https://example.com"),
    // other metadata properties
  };
}
```

## `locale` param

Hooks such as `useLocale` cannot be used in functions that are executed outside of rendering contexts. Such functions are for example all metadata routing files and `generateStaticParams` and `generateSitemap` functions.

For these functions the locale is included in the first argument object.

```tsx title="src/_app/sitemap.ts"
import type { Locale } from "next-globe-gen";

export async function generateSitemaps({ locale }: { locale: Locale }) {
  return [{ id: 0 }, { id: 1 }, { id: 2 }, { id: 3 }];
}

type SitemapParams = { id: number; locale: Locale };

export default function sitemap({ id, locale }: SitemapParams) {
  /* Sitemap generation logic */
}
```

:::info Routing Components

In rendering contexts the primary way to access the current locale is with [`useLocale`](./api-reference/hooks.mdx#uselocale) hook, but the locale is also passed as a prop to routing components.
