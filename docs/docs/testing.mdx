# Testing

Browser and end-to-end tests should work out of the box, since those tests are usually ran against the Next.js development or the production server. Unit testing client components requires a setup which provides the required context for the rendered client components.

## Unit Testing - Vitest

Following setup is intended to be used with Vitest and it might need to be modified for other testing libraries.

First follow the Next.js documentation for [setting up Vitest](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/testing/vitest).

Then define the following testing utility file:

```tsx title="./src/test-utils.tsx"
import { render, type RenderOptions } from "@testing-library/react";
import { IntlProvider } from "next-globe-gen/client";
import type { ReactNode } from "react";
import { messages } from "../next-globe-gen/messages";
import { schema } from "../next-globe-gen/schema";

const wrapper = ({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) => (
  <IntlProvider
    schema={schema}
    messages={messages[schema.defaultLocale]}
    locale={schema.defaultLocale}
  >
    {children}
  </IntlProvider>
);

const customRender = ((ui: ReactNode, options?: RenderOptions) => {
  return render(ui, { wrapper, ...options });
}) as typeof render;

// re-export everything
export * from "@testing-library/react";

// override render method
export { customRender as render };
```

Now the components can be tested like so:

```tsx title="./src/page.test.tsx"
import { render, screen } from "@/test-utils";
import { expect, test } from "vitest";
import Page from "./page";

test("Page", () => {
  render(<Page />);
  expect(
    screen.getByRole("heading", { level: 1, name: "NextGlobeGen Playground" }),
  ).toBeDefined();
});
```

:::warning

Vitest renders the components as client components. As so the tested component cannot be an async server component or it cannod use next-globe-gen APIs which are for server-side only. If the rendered component uses server-side only APIs, those have to be mocked.
