# Components

NextGlobeGen provides `Link` and `Form` components that wrap the Next.js components with the same names. These can be used to navigate to localized pathnames.

## \<Link>

`<Link>` is a React component that extends the Next.js [`<Link>`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/link) component to provide locale-aware navigation to localized pathnames. It is the primary way to navigate between localized routes.

```tsx
import { Link } from "next-globe-gen";

export default function Page() {
  return <Link href="/dashboard">Dashboard</Link>;
}
```

### Props

The following props can be passed to the `<Link>` component:

| Prop     | Example                     | Type                          | Required    |
| -------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------- |
| `href`   | `href="/dashboard"`         | `Route \| HrefOptions<Route>` | Yes         |
| `locale` | `locale="en"`               | `Locale`                      | -           |
| `params` | `params={{ slug: "slug" }}` | `RouteParams<Route>`          | Yes / No \* |

\* params prop is required only if the given route has dynamic segments.

:::info Good to know

In addition to the listed props, all of the Next.js `Link` component props can also be passed as props to the component.
