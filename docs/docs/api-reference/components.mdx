# Components

NextGlobeGen provides `Link` and `Form` components that wrap the Next.js components with the same names. These can be used to navigate to localized pathnames.

## \<Link>

`<Link>` is a React component that extends the Next.js [`<Link>`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/link) component to provide locale-aware navigation to localized pathnames. It is the primary way to navigate between localized routes.

```tsx
import { Link } from "next-globe-gen";

export default function Page() {
  return <Link href="/dashboard">Dashboard</Link>;
}
```

### Props

The following props can be passed to the `<Link>` component:

| Prop     | Example                 | Type                          | Required |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------- |
| `href`   | `href="/dashboard"`     | `Route \| HrefOptions<Route>` | Yes      |
| `locale` | `locale="en"`           | `Locale`                      | -        |
| `params` | `params={{ id: "id" }}` | `RouteParams<Route>`          | **\***   |

**\*** params prop is required only if the given route has dynamic segments.

:::info Good to know

In addition to the listed props, all of the Next.js `Link` component props can also be passed as props to the component.

:::

#### `href` (required)

The route, pathname or URL to navigate to. If the given `href` matches to a route that has localizations, it will be localized. Otherwise the `href` will be passed as it is to the Next.js `Link` component.

```tsx title="Using href prop"
// When the user is on `en` locale, the link will point to `/en/dashboard`
<Link href="/dashboard">
  Dashboard
</Link>

// Search params can be added via a `query`
<Link href={{ pathname: "/dashboard", query: { sortBy: "name" } }}>
  Dashboard
</Link>
```

#### `locale`

To switch to another language, one can pass a `locale` as a prop. It will also set the `hreflang` attribute to the anchor tag.

```tsx title="Using locale prop"
// Will point to `/fi/hallintapaneeli`
<Link href="/dashboard" locale="fi">
  Hallintapaneeli
</Link>

// If the href is given as an object, the locale should be passed in the object
<Link href={{ pathname: "/dashboard", locale: "fi" }}>
  Hallintapaneeli
</Link>
```

#### `params`

If the given href is a route that includes dynamic segments, the params for the route can be passed by a `params` prop.

```tsx title="Using params prop"
// When the user is on `en` locale, the link will point to `/en/images/43-image-slug`
<Link href="/images/[id]" params={{ id: "43-image-slug" }}>
  Image Slug
</Link>

// If the href is given as an object, the params should be passed in the object
<Link href={{ pathname: "/images/[id]", params: { id: "43-image-slug" } }}>
  Image Slug
</Link>
```

## \<Form>

`<Form>` is a React component that extends the Next.js [`<Form>`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/form) component so that the Next.js `Form` component enhancements work also with localized pathnames.

```tsx
import { Form } from "next-globe-gen";

export default function Page() {
  return (
    {/* On submission, the URL will change to /en/search?query=abc */}
    <Form action="/search">
      <input name="query" />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </Form>
  );
}
```

### Props

The following props can be passed to the `<Form>` component:

| Prop     | Example                       | Type                 | Required |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------- | -------- |
| `action` | `action="/search"`            | `Route`              | Yes      |
| `locale` | `locale="en"`                 | `Locale`             | -        |
| `params` | `params={{ user: "Jon1VK" }}` | `RouteParams<Route>` | **\***   |

**\*** params prop is required only if the given route has dynamic segments.

:::info Good to know

In addition to the listed props, all of the Next.js `Form` component props can also be passed as props to the component.

:::

#### `action` (required)

The route, pathname or URL to navigate to. If the given `action` matches to a route that has localizations, it will be localized. Otherwise the `action` will be passed as it is to the Next.js `Form` component.

```tsx title="Using action prop"
// When the user is on `en` locale, the form will navigate to `/en/search?query=abc`
<Form action="/search">{/* Inputs */}</Form>
```

#### `locale`

To switch to another language, one can pass a `locale` as a prop.

```tsx title="Using locale prop"
// Form will navigate to `/fi/haku?query=abc`
<Form action="/search" locale="fi">
  {/* Inputs */}
</Form>
```

#### `params`

If the given action is a route that includes dynamic segments, the params for the route can be passed by a `params` prop.

```tsx title="Using params prop"
// When the user is on `en` locale, the form will navigate to `/en/blog/Jon1VK?query=abc`
<Form action="/blog/[user]" params={{ user: "Jon1VK" }}>
  {/* Inputs */}
</Form>
```
