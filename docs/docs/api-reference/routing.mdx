# Routing

With NextGlobeGen, the application routes are created to a special `src/_app` directory. In this directory all Next.js file-system based routing rules apply and all Next.js specific routing files work exactly the same as in `src/app` directory. Localized routes are generated to `src/app/(i18n)` directory based on the contents in the `src/_app` origin directory.

The localized route directory `src/app/(i18n)` should not be modified. Other non-localized routes, such as `api` routes, can still be added to the root of the `src/app` directory.

In addition to Next.js specific routing files, NextGlobeGen adds a few routing file conventions of its own. NextGlobeGen also passes the current locale to all functions that cannot infer it from the rendering context.

:::info Configuring directory locations

Default directory locations can be altered through [configuration](./configuration.mdx#routes).

## Localized pathnames

The pathnames in the url often need to be translated to improve SEO. In NextGlobeGen this is done for each route segment (directory) separately with special `i18n.ts` files. With this approach the route segment and it's localizations can be colocated.

### Static translations

The simplest way to translate a route segment is to export as a default export an object which includes localized versions of the route segment for each locale.

```ts title="src/_app/dashboard/i18n.ts"
const segmentTranslations = {
  en: "dashboard", // If omitted, the directory name is used
  fi: "hallintapaneeli",
};

export default segmentTranslations;
```

### With an async function

Another way to translate a route segment is to export as a default export an async function that returns the route segment localizations as an object.

```ts title="src/_app/dashboard/i18n.ts"
export default async function generateSegmentTranslations() {
  /* Fetch translations for example from an external source  */
  return {
    en: "dashboard", // If omitted, the directory name is used
    fi: "hallintapaneeli",
  };
}
```

:::info

- Each [parallel route](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes) segment needs to be localized separately.
- [Intercepted route](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes) segments have to include the segment matcher in the translations. For example a Finnish translation of `(..)photo` would be `(..)kuva`.

## Markdown pages

NextGlobeGen has a support for markdown and MDX pages by using a locale specific file convention. To use markdown pages, first follow [Next.js MDX docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/mdx) on how to configure Next.js so it can process markdown and MDX.

Then create a `page.<locale>.md` or `page.<locale>.mdx` file for each configured locale in the route segment directory from where the markdown page should be served. NextGlobeGen will use the correct markdown page for each locale based on the `<locale>` part of the filename.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="English MDX Page" >

```mdx title="./src/_app/markdown/page.en.mdx"
export const metadata = { title: "Markdown page" };

# Markdown page

This content is shown on `/en/markdown` path.
```

</TabItem >
<TabItem value="Finnish MDX Page">

```mdx title="./src/_app/markdown/page.fi.mdx"
export const metadata = { title: "Markdown sivu" };

# Markdown sivu

Tämä sisältö näytetään `/fi/markdown` polussa.
```

</TabItem >
</Tabs>

## `locale` prop/param

In rendering contexts the primary way to access the current locale is with [`useLocale`](./hooks.mdx#uselocale) hook. The locale is also passed as a prop to routing components.

```tsx title="src/_app/page.tsx"
import type { Locale } from "next-globe-gen";

export default function Home({ locale }: { locale: Locale }) {
  /* Component rendering logic */
}
```

Hooks cannot be used in functions exported from metadata routing files, such as `icon.tsx` or `sitemap.ts`, or in most of the generate functions such as `generateStaticParams` or `generateSitemaps`. For these functions the locale is included in the first argument object.

```tsx title="src/_app/sitemap.ts"
import type { Locale } from "next-globe-gen";

export async function generateSitemaps({ locale }: { locale: Locale }) {
  return [{ id: 0 }, { id: 1 }, { id: 2 }, { id: 3 }];
}

type SitemapParams = { id: number; locale: Locale };

export default function sitemap({ id, locale }: SitemapParams) {
  /* Sitemap generation logic */
}
```
